This is it, my last blog post! It's been a long journey, roughly a year, going through the most exciting learning curve of my life. When I look back I can't believe all the milestones I've achieved, I am now able to understand and write code in Ruby, Javascript, SQL, HTML and CSS, not to mention super useful frameworks like Rails or React.

I read an article couple of weeks ago which stated that the best developers are those who spend more time on the ideation phase and figuring out what's the most effective and efficient solution to solve a problem rather than jumping into coding straight away. I've always had that kind of mindset, trying to understand all the aspects that come in to play before jumping into conclussion which is why I think software development was the right call for me.

I am now very excited about the path I'm taking for the future, knowing that I've acquired the most useful skills in my toolbox for the years to come. I can't wait to see how many doors that were closed before, are now going to be widely open.

I just want to say thanks to everyone who made this bootcamp possible and also encourage people who are at the beginning of their journey now to keep on trying. It will get tought at some point but it definetely pays off.

That's all from me for now... see you around!
