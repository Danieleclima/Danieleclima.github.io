One year and a half ago my coding knowledge was so limited that I wasn't aware that Javascript is the language which powers and provides funtionality to the whole wide web, I also had no idea what an API endpoint was, let alone how easy it is to create one using Ruby on Rails.

At the moment, I am very far away from knowing and understanding the ins and outs of Javascript and Ruby, speacilly what goes on under the hood sometimes, however I'm also light years away from where I started as now I can confidently code not only in Javascript or Ruby but also using some of their most popular libraries like React/Redux, Rails, Sinatra, not to mention HTML, CSS or Bootstrap.

My experience with coding so far has been very challenging and fast paced, but what I found to be most fascinating about coding is the amount of things you can learn in a couple of weeks once you are able to undestand the basics. what's even more outstanding is how supportive the software development can be, it's great to be surrounded with people that have experienced the same issues as you at some point and are always willing to give you a hand if you get stuck.

The way ahead looks promising, my goal is to learn quite a few new languages. Angular, NodeJS, Java and PHP are among my favourites, what languages would you like to learn next?
