When I submitted my final project, I knew that I had just laid the foundations for what was going to be a long-term ongoing project. Thanks to version control, an application that might look pretty basic in its infancy might grow to be an state-of-the-art app further down the line, this is why coding is a journey like many things in life.

The goal I've set my mind to is developing a Progressive Web App. I honestly think that PWAs are the future of mobile apps basically because they take advantage of the latest technologies to combine the best of web and mobile apps. Think of it as a website built using web technologies but that acts and feels like an app. Delivering this app-like experience to users withouth them having to actually download the app is key since installing a new app on a mobile phone is what's considered a high friction step from the user's point of view. Not to mentione, that PWAs can still be used when there's no internet connection like an honest-to-god mobile app, sounds cool right? I know because they are bsically FIRE:

* **F**ast: PWAs provide experiences that are consistently fast. From the moment a user downloads an app to the moment they start interacting with it, everything happens really fast. Because you can cache the data, it is extremely fast to start the app again even without hitting the network.

* **I**ntegrated user experience: PWAs feel and behave like native apps. They sit in a user’s home screen, send push notifications like native apps, and have access to a device’s functionalities like native apps. The experience feels seamless and integrated.

* **R**eliable experience: With the help of service workers, we can reliably paint a picture on a user’s screen even when network has failed.

* **E**ngaging: Because we can send notifications to a user, we can really drive the engagement up by keeping the user notified and engaged with the app.

See why PWAs are a hot topic these days? In order to create one you basically need these things:

* Web App Manifest
* Service Workers
* Served over HTTPS

I will cover the first two points in future Blogposts, this is the start of a series of articles about PWAs, hope you are ready for what's coming!
